## Motivation
Solar power is one of the cheapest and fastest-growing energy sources in the world, offering a clean and sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. However, the efficiency of solar panels is highly dependent on their orientation relative to the sun. Fixed-position panels often miss out on optimal sunlight throughout the day, leading to energy losses. 

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to obtain the maximum energy production, balancing the aspect ratio as well as incidence angle to maximize energy return.
